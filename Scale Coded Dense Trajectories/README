#Scale Coded Dense Trajectories

Dense Trajctory Computation as per:
[1] Wang, Heng, et al. "Dense trajectories and motion boundary descriptors for action recognition." International journal of computer vision 103.1 (2013): 60-79.

The code from https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/wang/dense_trajectories was adapted for python 3.7
Dense Trajectory features generated is saved as "(video_path)_features.txt"
Scale Coded DT features saved as "(video_path)_features_scale_coded.txt"

Additional Software Packages Required:
numpy 1.17.2
opencv-python 4.1.1.26
