#Scale Coded Dense Trajectories

Generate scale coded dense trajectoires from a video located at path 'root'.
Programme is run from 'run.py'

Dense Trajctory Computation as per:
[1] Wang, Heng, et al. "Dense trajectories and motion boundary descriptors for action recognition." International journal of computer vision 103.1 (2013): 60-79.

The code from https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/wang/dense_trajectories was adapted for python 3.7
Dense Trajectory features generated is saved as "(video_path)_features.txt"
The Scale Coded BoW from DT features i saved as "(video_path)_features_scale_coded.txt"

Additional Software Packages Required:
numpy 1.17.2
opencv-python 4.1.1.26
